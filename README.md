# bookmark

**A cross-platform command line bookmarking tool**

With bookmark you can type `bm myProject` to move to a bookmarked directory instead of `cd /really/long/path/to/myProject`.


## What?
I ain't tryin' to waste my time typing out long paths all day.  If you have used python's virtualenvwrapper before, you might miss how the `workon` command can switch directories for you. Bookmark aims to be like that, but for any directory.

Much better right?


## Install
Bookmark requires [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)

```
$ npm install -g bookmark
```

_then, for **bash** / **zsh**:_

```
$ . bm --add-alias
```
Bookmark relies on .sh/.bat scripts to do its magic. Bookmark feeds those scripts the path you want to `cd` to. For a script's `cd` command to actually change the directory in your current shell you need to 'source' that script.

Typing `$ source bm <bookmark>` every time is lame. You can avoid typing `source` each time by manually adding an alias (`bm="source bm"`) to your `.bash_aliases` or `.bashrc`, or you can let bookmark try to add it for you with `$ . bm --add-alias`.

## How to use
```
Usage: bm [options] [command]

Commands:

  add <bookmark_name> [bookmark_path]
  update <bookmark_name> [bookmark_path]
  remove <bookmark_name>
  list [bookmark_name]
  <bookmark_name>

Options:

  -h, --help  output usage information
  -v  output the version number
```

Commands can also be truncated for less typing:
- add / a
- update / up / u
- remove / rm / r
- list / ls / l

Bookmarks are saved in `bookmark.db` in your home directory.

## Examples
```
# Add a bookmark called myProject at current location:
$ bm add myProject

  Bookmark added:
  myProject C:\User\Person\Projects\myProjectStuff

# Add a bookmark called myProject at given path:
$ bm add myProject \User\Person\Projects\myProjectStuff

  Bookmark added:
  myProject C:\User\Person\Projects\myProjectStuff

# cd to your bookmark's directory
$ bm myProject
```


## Is there a better way to do this?
Probably, but I don't know what it is. I've seen some complex shell scripts floating around the web, but they didn't seem to do exactly what I wanted and I couldn't find any solutions for Windows machines.

It might have been better to exclude Node and only use .sh/.bat scripts, but my .sh/.bat-scripting-fu isn't up to that challenge.
